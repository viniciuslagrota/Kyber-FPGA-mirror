TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.140 ns between kyberBD_i/axi_gpio_2/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.gpio2_Data_Out_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and kyberBD_i/barret_reduce_0/U0/data_out_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.205 ns between kyberBD_i/axi_gpio_2/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.gpio2_Data_Out_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and kyberBD_i/barret_reduce_0/U0/data_out_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
